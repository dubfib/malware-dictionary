    <h2>WannaCry</h2>
    <blockquote><i>A type of ransomware that encrypts user files until they pay a ransom, known as crypto-ransomware. </i></blockquote>
    
    <h3>How did it work?</h3>
    <blockquote>The WannaCry ransomware attack was a global cyberattack in May 2017 that used EternalBlue, an exploit developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) for Windows systems. EternalBlue was leaked by a group called The Shadow Brokers a month prior to the attack. EternalBlue exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft's Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, which allows computers to share files and printers over a network. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send specially crafted packets to a vulnerable computer that causes the computer to execute arbitrary code. Microsoft even released a patch two months before the attack happened that would have kept computers safe from this attack, yet many people did not update their systems, which allowed this attack to happen.</blockquote>

    <h3>What impact did it have?</h3>
    <blockquote>The WannaCry ransomware attack had a significant impact on individuals, businesses, and governments around the world. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in over 150 countries and caused billions of dollars in damages. The attack had a particularly devastating impact on the National Health Service (NHS) in the United Kingdom. The attack caused the closure of many NHS hospitals and clinics and disrupted the delivery of healthcare to millions of people. The attack also had a significant impact on businesses, including Telef√≥nica, a Spanish telecommunications company, and FedEx, a global shipping company. The WannaCry attack was a wake-up call for the world and highlighted the need for greater cybersecurity measures. The attack also led to calls for governments to take action to protect their citizens from cyberattacks. Microsoft also provided free support to help organizations recover from the attack.</blockquote>

    <h3>How did it spread?</h3>
    <blockquote>WannaCry spreads through email attachments and malicious websites. Email attachments that contained WannaCry were disguised as legitimate emails. When a user opened the email attachment, WannaCry was installed on the user's computer. Malicious websites that contained WannaCry were designed to trick users into clicking on a link that would install WannaCry on their computers. Researchers found that WannaCry was being spread through USB drives in industrial settings. The researchers found that WannaCry was being installed on USB drives that were then being inserted into computers at industrial facilities. The WannaCry infection would then spread to other computers on the network, causing disruptions and damage.</blockquote>

    <h3>What did it do to someone's computer?</h3>
    <blockquote>WannaCry is ransomware that encrypts the files on a computer and demands a ransom payment in Bitcoin in order to decrypt the files. The ransomware spreads through a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows, and it can be spread through email attachments, malicious websites, and USB drives. When WannaCry infects a computer, it scans the computer for files that can be encrypted. The files that are encrypted include documents, photos, videos, and music. Once the files are encrypted, WannaCry displays a message on the computer that demands a ransom payment of $300 in Bitcoin. The message also states that the files will be deleted if the ransom is not paid within three days. If not paid within 72 hours, the ransom will be lifted to $600 in Bitcoin. It is unclear how many people paid the ransom for WannaCry. Some estimates suggest that as many as 200 people paid the ransom, while others suggest that the number was much lower.  Although some people report that they didn't receive a decryption key even after the ransom was paid. It is not known how many people paid the ransom. Some researchers claimed that no one got their data back, while a company called F-Secure claimed that some did. However, the coding used in the attack was faulty, so even if someone paid the ransom, there was no guarantee that they would get their files back.</blockquote>

    <h3>How was it stopped?</h3>
    <blockquote>The WannaCry ransomware attack was stopped by a security researcher who discovered a kill switch that prevented the ransomware from spreading. The kill switch was a domain name that was hardcoded into the ransomware. When the ransomware tried to connect to the domain name, it would receive a response that would prevent it from spreading. The security researcher who discovered the kill switch was Marcus Hutchins, a 22-year-old British cybersecurity researcher. Hutchins was able to discover the kill switch by analyzing the code of the ransomware. After discovering the kill switch, Hutchins registered the domain name and effectively stopped the spread of the ransomware. Hutchins' actions were praised by many in the cybersecurity community. He was named "Person of the Year" by Wired magazine in 2017. Hutchins was also awarded the "Defender of the Year" award by the SANS Institute. The WannaCry attack was a major disaster, but it was also averted thanks to the quick thinking and expertise of Marcus Hutchins.</blockquote>

    <h3>Is it a threat today?</h3>
    <blockquote>WannaCry is still a threat today, but it is not as dangerous as it was in 2017. The main reason for this is that Microsoft has released patches for the vulnerability that was exploited by WannaCry. These patches have been installed on most Windows computers, so the ransomware is no longer able to spread as easily. In addition, most antivirus programs flag WannaCry rather instantly because it existed for a long time and how much damage it has done. However, WannaCry is still a threat to computers that are not up to date with the latest security patches. These computers are vulnerable to ransomware, and they could be infected if they are connected to a network that is infected with WannaCry.</blockquote>
